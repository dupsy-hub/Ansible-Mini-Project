 Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Create an Inventory File
Create a file named inventory and include at least two remote hosts

2. Write the Ansible Playbook

3. Create a Bash Script
Create a script named copy_passwd.sh

4. Running the Playbook:
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory

5. Run Ad-hoc Commands
Check Connectivity:
ansible all -m ping -i inventory

Ensure the script is executable by running the following command on the control node:
chmod +x copy_passwd.sh

ansible all -i inventory -m copy -a "src=copy_passwd.sh dest=/tmp/copy_passwd.sh mode=0755" 

ansible all -i inventory -m shell -a "/tmp/copy_passwd.sh"
